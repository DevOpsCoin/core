# Ship-It Fund — Funding Guide

This document explains how **DevOpsCoin evaluates project submissions** for the Ship-It Fund.  
It ensures all grant decisions follow consistent, transparent, and verifiable standards.

---

## Evaluation Principles

Each submission is reviewed according to three primary pillars:

| Pillar           | Description                                                                     | Example                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Impact**       | Creates measurable value for developers, builders, or the open-source ecosystem | CLI tools, automation utilities, or creative OSS projects |
| **Feasibility**  | Can be reasonably delivered within defined scope and timeline                   | MVP or milestone clearly specified                        |
| **Transparency** | Code, commits, and communication are open and verifiable                        | GitHub repository, public roadmap, visible issues         |

> High impact and strong open-source alignment indicate strong candidacy.

## Evaluation Process

1. **Initial Screening** — Confirm eligibility, license, and repository accessibility
2. **Technical Review** — Evaluate code quality, maintainability, and deliverability
3. **Impact Assessment** — Assess potential adoption and usefulness within the community
4. **Final Decision** — Maintainer or LLC reviewer approves, leading to a `/ledger` entry

All decisions are documented publicly in the issue thread and in `/ledger` once finalized.

---

## Funding Method

- Grants are paid in **DEVOPS tokens** from the **Ship-It Fund wallet**
- Disbursements may occur in full or as milestone-based tranches
- Each disbursement is logged in `/ledger` with its Solana transaction hash
- Once recorded, entries are immutable and publicly verifiable
- **TreasuryOps (SOL)** provides operational top-ups when Ship-It reserves are low, but is never used for direct grant payouts

---

## Communication & Reporting

- All communication occurs in the GitHub issue thread
- Approved grants may be featured on the DevOpsCoin website and official channels
- Quarterly summaries are published in `/ledger/reports/`
- Every cycle follows the **Ship → Show → Verify** model:
  - **Ship** — Review and approve grant
  - **Show** — Record transaction and details in ledger
  - **Verify** — Confirm on-chain transaction and ledger integrity
