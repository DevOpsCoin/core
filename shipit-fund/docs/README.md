# Ship-It Fund Reporting Standards

This directory defines how **quarterly reports** are published for the Ship-It Fund and TreasuryOps transparency logs.  
Each report provides a verified snapshot of grant activity, top-ups, and remaining balances.

---

## Purpose

Quarterly reports ensure that all DevOpsCoin ecosystem movements — including **Ship-It Fund grants**, **TreasuryOps top-ups**, and **vesting releases** — remain transparent, traceable, and publicly auditable.

Every report follows a standardized format for easy validation, consistent with the principles of **Ship → Show → Verify**.

---

## Report Structure

Each quarterly report includes three sections:

| Section          | Description                                                                           |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Summary**      | Overview of Ship-It Fund activity, TreasuryOps top-ups, and total distributed amounts |
| **Grants**       | List of all projects funded within the quarter, referencing ledger entries            |
| **Verification** | Ledger hash summary and on-chain transaction cross-checks                             |

---

## File Naming Convention

Reports are versioned by fiscal quarter:

```
/reports/
 ├── Q1_2025_REPORT.md
 ├── Q2_2025_REPORT.md
 ├── Q3_2025_REPORT.md
 └── Q4_2025_REPORT.md
```

Each report includes a signed verification hash at the bottom matching the ledger state at the time of publication.

## Publication Workflow

1. Finalize and sign all quarterly ledger YAML entries.
2. Run `verify-ledger.sh` to confirm all hashes and signatures match.
3. Generate the quarterly report in Markdown following the above template.
4. Commit and push the report to `/docs/reports/` with the format `QX_YYYY_REPORT.md`.
5. Announce the release via the DevOpsCoin website and Telegram.

---

## Verification & Audit Trail

Each report cross-references:

- `/ledger` — Immutable grant records
- `/reports` — Public quarterly summaries
- `verify-ledger.sh` — Automated validation
- Solscan — On-chain confirmation of all disbursement transactions

> The purpose of reports is not just disclosure — it’s reproducibility.  
> Anyone should be able to verify every number and transaction independently.
