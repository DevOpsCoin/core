### ✅ What’s Public

- Full Next.js source code for the website and investor portal
- Token and vesting contract addresses (mainnet & testnet)
- Open source hooks, constants, and pricing logic

### 🔒 What’s Private

To maintain security and prevent abuse, the following are **not** included in this repo:

### 🤝 Why It’s Open
