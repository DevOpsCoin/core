### 💠 Support NFT (Contribution Path)

The **Support NFT** allows individuals to contribute voluntarily to DevOpsCoin’s mission.  
All proceeds are directed to the **Ship-It Fund**, which finances open-source and DevOps-aligned initiatives.

> The Support NFT is not a grant, investment, or staking mechanism — it’s simply a way to support the ecosystem.

### 🤝 Why It’s Open

DevOpsCoin’s transparency model treats governance and deployment as observable pipelines.  
Every commit, contract, and transfer is meant to be traceable.

> Transparency is infrastructure.
