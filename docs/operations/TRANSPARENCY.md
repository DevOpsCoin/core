# Transparency & Public Verification

DevOpsCoin operates on one non-negotiable principle: **transparency is built into the system.**  
This document defines how the **Ship-It Fund**, **TreasuryOps Wallet**, and **Founder Vesting Program** are verified, logged, and made publicly auditable — both on-chain and in this repository.

---

## Transparency Philosophy

DevOpsCoin applies DevOps principles — **automation, observability, and accountability** — to blockchain governance.  
Every operation is measurable, reproducible, and reviewable.

We believe in:

- **Automation over discretion**
- **Verification over assumption**
- **Execution over expectation**

All fund operations are handled by **DevOpsCoin LLC** and recorded either on-chain (Solana) or in this repository for full public review.

## Core Transparency Components

| Wallet / Program                   | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                     | Transparency Mechanism                                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ship-It Fund (DEVOPS)**          | Transparent grant treasury for open-source sponsorships. Issues monthly grants; rolls forward if volume falls short. Never sells DEVOPS.                                    | Public Solana wallet, on-chain transactions, and monthly ledger logs.  |
| **TreasuryOps (SOL + 2 % DEVOPS)** | Holds SOL from creator rewards and a 2 % DEVOPS bootstrap allocation. Funds marketing, liquidity, operations, and buybacks. Provides Ship-It top-ups when reserves decline. | On-chain SOL transactions, transparency ledger, and monthly summaries. |
| **Founder Vesting**                | 10 % founder allocation with a 3-month cliff and 20-month linear vesting schedule to ensure long-term alignment and public trust.                                           | On-chain vesting contract and public vesting logs.                     |

## Ship-It Fund Transparency

The **Ship-It Fund** serves as a transparent, auditable grant pool for open-source development.

- Issues **monthly grants** when ecosystem volume supports it.
- Rolls forward when activity slows.
- Holds only DEVOPS tokens — never sold or swapped.
- May receive SOL top-ups from TreasuryOps as needed.

All movements are verifiable through:

- **On-chain Solana transactions**
- **Monthly ledger reports** in [`shipit-fund`](../../shipit-fund/)
- **Signed commits** for every disbursement or modification

For detailed policy and structure, see [**Ship-It Fund Documentation →**](../token/SHIPIT_FUND.md)

### Ledger Verification

The canonical record of all Ship-It Fund transactions lives in  
[`shipit-fund/ledger`](../../shipit-fund/ledger/).

Each YAML entry includes project details, grant amounts, Solana transaction hashes, and reviewer signatures.  
Verification is automated via [`verify-ledger.sh`](../../shipit-fund/ledger/verify-ledger.sh), which checks:

- SHA-256 integrity of all ledger files
- Missing or duplicate transaction hashes
- Signature consistency and authenticity

All results are verifiable both in-repo and on-chain.

> Accountability isn’t marketing — it’s measurable.

## TreasuryOps Transparency

The **TreasuryOps wallet** manages all SOL-based ecosystem operations.

- Begins with a **2 % DEVOPS allocation (20 M tokens)** for bootstrap liquidity.
- Receives **creator-reward inflows in SOL** from Pump.fun and PumpSwap.
- Funds **marketing, liquidity, operations, and buybacks.**
- Provides **SOL top-ups** to the Ship-It Fund as needed.

Activity is fully verifiable through:

- **Public Solana wallet history**
- **Monthly ledger entries** in `/docs/ledger/TREASURY_LOG.md`
- **Cross-referenced transaction hashes** linked to signed commits

For additional details, see [**Treasury Refill Policy →**](../token/TREASURY_REFILL_POLICY.md)

## Founder Vesting Transparency

| Parameter          | Value                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **Allocation**     | 10 % (100 M DEVOPS)            |
| **Cliff**          | 3 months                       |
| **Vesting Period** | 20 months linear (5 % / month) |
| **Network**        | Solana                         |
| **Beneficiary**    | RootSignal (Founder)           |

Tokens unlock automatically through an immutable on-chain contract.  
All vesting events are visible on Solana and summarized quarterly in transparency logs.

## Verification Methods

A unified verification workflow applies across all programs:

- **On-chain explorer links (Solscan)** for every transaction.
- **Signed ledger entries** under `/docs/ledger/` and `../../shipit-fund/ledger/`.
- **Time-stamped commits** for each top-up or grant disbursement.
- **Public records** for every material governance action.

Each entry includes: _date, purpose, amount, wallet addresses, transaction hash, and signature._  
No hidden transfers. No off-ledger activity.

---

## Community Oversight

- **Verify** — audit transactions directly on-chain.
- **Review** — compare ledger entries against Solana records.
- **Contribute** — propose or support open-source projects eligible for funding.
- **Discuss** — engage via GitHub Discussions or Telegram.

Transparency is only complete when the community verifies it.

---

## Guiding Principle

DevOpsCoin exists to **fund reality, not speculation.**  
Transparency isn’t a feature — it’s the foundation.
