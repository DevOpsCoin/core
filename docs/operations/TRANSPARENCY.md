# Transparency & Public Verification

DevOpsCoin operates under the belief that **transparency is infrastructure**.  
This document explains how the **Ship-It Fund**, **TreasuryOps Wallet**, and **Founder Vesting Program** are verified, logged, and auditable across both on-chain and repository records.

## 🧭 Transparency Philosophy

DevOpsCoin applies DevOps principles — **automation, observability, and accountability** — to blockchain governance.  
Every action is measurable, reproducible, and reviewable — just like a CI/CD pipeline.

We believe in:

- **Automation over discretion**  
- **Verification over assumption**  
- **Transparency over hype**

All fund operations are executed by **DevOpsCoin LLC** and recorded either on-chain (Solana) or in this repository for public review.

## 💧 Core Transparency Components

| Wallet / Program            | Purpose                                                                                  | Transparency Mechanism                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ship-It Fund (DEVOPS)**    | Dedicated to open-source grants and community sponsorships. Issues monthly grants; rolls over if volume falls short. Never sells DEVOPS. | Public Solana wallet + on-chain transactions + monthly ledger reports |
| **TreasuryOps (SOL)**        | Holds SOL from creator rewards; funds marketing, liquidity, operations, and buybacks. Periodically tops up Ship-It reserves. | On-chain SOL transactions + transparency ledger + periodic summaries |
| **Founder Vesting**          | 10% founder allocation with 3-month cliff and 20-month linear vesting. Ensures long-term alignment and trust. | On-chain vesting contract + public vesting log |

> All three wallets — Founder Vesting, Ship-It Fund, and TreasuryOps — form the transparent foundation of the DevOpsCoin ecosystem.

## 🪙 Ship-It Fund Transparency

The **Ship-It Fund** operates as a dedicated grant treasury for open-source innovation.  

- Issues **monthly grants** when ecosystem trading volume supports it  
- Rolls grants forward when volume dips below the threshold  
- Holds only DEVOPS tokens (never sold or swapped)  
- May receive top-ups from the TreasuryOps wallet to sustain future grants  

All movements are verifiable through:

- **On-chain Solana transactions**  
- **Monthly ledger reports** in the [`shipit-fund`](https://github.com/DevOpsCoin/shipit-fund) repository  
- **Time-stamped commits and signatures** for every disbursement  

For full policy and grant details, see:  
➡ [Ship-It Fund Documentation →](../docs/SHIPIT_FUND.md)

## 🧾 TreasuryOps Transparency

The **TreasuryOps wallet** is the operational engine behind DevOpsCoin’s ecosystem.  

It manages all SOL-based liquidity and funding operations:

- Receives **creator reward inflows** from Pump.fun and PumpSwap  
- Covers **marketing, operations, liquidity management, and buybacks**  
- Provides **SOL top-ups** to the Ship-It Fund when grant reserves fall below target  

All transactions are transparent and auditable via:

- **Public Solana wallet activity**  
- **Ledger entries** published monthly in `/docs/ledger/TREASURY_LOG.md`  
- **Cross-referenced transaction hashes** in verified repository commits  

For policy and refill rules, see:  
➡ [Treasury Refill Policy →](../docs/TREASURY_REFILL_POLICY.md)

## 👤 Founder Vesting Transparency

| Parameter          | Value                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **Allocation**     | 10 % (100 M DEVOPS)            |
| **Cliff**          | 3 months (no release)          |
| **Vesting Period** | 20 months linear (5 % / month) |
| **Network**        | Solana                         |
| **Beneficiary**    | RootSignal (Founder)           |

Tokens unlock trustlessly through an immutable vesting contract.  
All events are visible on-chain and summarized quarterly in the transparency logs.

## 🔍 Verification Methods

DevOpsCoin maintains a unified verification workflow across all wallets:

- **Solana explorer links (Solscan)** for every wallet transaction  
- **Signed ledger entries** under `/docs/ledger/`  
- **Time-stamped commits** for each movement or top-up  
- **Public discussions** for major grant or operational proposals  

Each ledger entry includes:

- Date and purpose  
- Token or SOL amount  
- Wallets involved  
- Transaction hash  
- Verification signature  

No hidden transfers. No off-ledger movements.

---

## 📢 Community Oversight

- **Verify** — audit all wallet transactions directly on-chain  
- **Review** — cross-check ledger entries with Solana explorers  
- **Discuss** — join GitHub Discussions or Telegram to review grants or expenditures  
- **Contribute** — propose open-source projects eligible for Ship-It Fund support

## 🧱 Guiding Principle

DevOpsCoin isn’t built on committees or speculation — it’s built on **pipelines, proof, and public accountability**.

> **“Pipelines, not politics.”**
