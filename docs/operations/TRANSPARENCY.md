# Transparency & Public Verification

DevOpsCoin operates under the belief that **transparency is infrastructure**.  
This document explains how the **Ship-It Fund** and **Founder Vesting Program** are verified, logged, and auditable across both on-chain and repository records.

## 🧭 Transparency Philosophy

DevOpsCoin applies DevOps principles — **automation, observability, and accountability** — to blockchain governance.  
Every action is measurable, reproducible, and reviewable — just like a CI/CD pipeline.

We believe in:

- **Automation over discretion**
- **Verification over assumption**
- **Transparency over hype**

All fund operations are executed by **DevOpsCoin LLC** and recorded either on-chain (Solana) or in this repository for public review.

## 💧 Core Transparency Components

| Fund / Program              | Purpose                                                                                   | Transparency Mechanism                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ship-It Fund**            | Dual-purpose fund supporting open-source DevOps projects **and** maintaining token health | Public Solana wallet + on-chain transactions + quarterly ledger reports |
| **Founder Vesting Program** | 3-month cliff + 20-month linear vesting (5 % per month) for founder allocation            | On-chain vesting program + public ledger updates                        |

There are **no separate treasury, community, or NFT-based wallets**.  
The **Ship-It Fund** is the single operational wallet used for ecosystem stability and open-source development.

## 🪙 Ship-It Fund Transparency

The Ship-It Fund receives **an initial bootstrap allocation** at launch to enable early grants and liquidity operations.  
After launch, it is sustained by **creator-reward inflows** generated from the [$DEVOPS token on Pump.fun](https://pump.fun/).

There are **no transaction taxes or fees** within the token contract — all inflows depend on trading volume and creator rewards.  
When activity slows, Ship-It Fund grants may be **deferred and rolled forward** to maintain fiscal stability.

All movements are verifiable through:

- **On-chain Solana transactions**
- **Quarterly ledger reports** in the [`shipit-fund`](https://github.com/DevOpsCoin/shipit-fund) repository
- **Time-stamped commits** and signatures for all disbursement records

For a detailed breakdown of governance, allocations, and reporting, see:

## 👤 Founder Vesting Transparency

| Parameter          | Value                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **Allocation**     | 10 % (100 M DEVOPS)            |
| **Cliff**          | 3 months (no release)          |
| **Vesting Period** | 20 months linear (5 % / month) |
| **Chain**          | Solana                         |
| **Beneficiary**    | RootSignal (Founder)           |

All vesting events are visible on-chain and summarized in quarterly transparency logs.

## 🔍 Verification Methods

- **Solana explorer links (Solscan)** for all wallet activity
- **Signed ledger entries** in `/docs/ledger/`
- **Time-stamped commits** documenting every change
- **Public discussions** for major proposals or grants

Each ledger entry includes:

- Date and purpose
- Amount and direction
- Wallets involved
- Transaction hash (if on-chain)
- Verification signature

No hidden transfers. No off-ledger movements.

---

## 📢 Community Oversight

- **Verify** — Audit fund transactions directly on-chain
- **Review** — Compare ledger entries against on-chain records
- **Discuss** — Join GitHub Discussions or Telegram to review fund disbursements
- **Contribute** — Propose new open-source projects to be funded by the Ship-It Fund

## 🧱 Guiding Principle

DevOpsCoin isn’t built on committees or speculation — it’s built on **pipelines, proof, and public accountability**.

> “Pipelines, not politics.”
