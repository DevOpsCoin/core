# Transparency & Public Verification

DevOpsCoin operates under the belief that **transparency is infrastructure**.  
This document explains how the **Ship-It Fund**, **TreasuryOps Wallet**, and **Founder Vesting Program** are verified, logged, and auditable across both on-chain and repository records.

## 🧭 Transparency Philosophy

DevOpsCoin applies DevOps principles — **automation, observability, and accountability** — to blockchain governance.  
Every action is measurable, reproducible, and reviewable — just like a CI/CD pipeline.

We believe in:

- **Automation over discretion**
- **Verification over assumption**
- **Transparency over hype**

All fund operations are executed by **DevOpsCoin LLC** and recorded on-chain (Solana) or in this repository for public review.

## 💧 Core Transparency Components

| Wallet / Program                   | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                     | Transparency Mechanism                                                |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ship-It Fund (DEVOPS)**          | Dedicated to open-source grants and community sponsorships. Issues monthly grants; rolls over if volume falls short. Never sells DEVOPS.                                    | Public Solana wallet + on-chain transactions + monthly ledger reports |
| **TreasuryOps (SOL + 2 % DEVOPS)** | Holds SOL from creator rewards and a 2 % DEVOPS bootstrap allocation. Funds marketing, liquidity, operations, and buybacks. Provides Ship-It top-ups when reserves run low. | On-chain SOL transactions + transparency ledger + periodic summaries  |
| **Founder Vesting**                | 10 % founder allocation with 3-month cliff and 20-month linear vesting. Ensures long-term alignment and trust.                                                              | On-chain vesting contract + public vesting log                        |

## 🪙 Ship-It Fund Transparency

The **Ship-It Fund** operates as a dedicated grant treasury for open-source innovation.

- Issues **monthly grants** when ecosystem trading volume supports it
- Rolls grants forward when volume dips below threshold
- Holds only DEVOPS tokens (never sold or swapped)
- May receive top-ups from the TreasuryOps wallet to sustain grants

All movements are verifiable through:

- **On-chain Solana transactions**
- **Monthly ledger reports** in the [`shipit-fund`](../../shipit-fund/) directory
- **Time-stamped commits and signatures** for every disbursement

For full policy and grant details, see:  
➡ [Ship-It Fund Documentation →](../token/SHIPIT_FUND.md)

### 🔍 Ledger Verification & Access

The canonical record of all Ship-It Fund transactions lives in the  
[**Ship-It Fund Ledger →**](../../shipit-fund/ledger/).  
Each ledger file is written in YAML and includes project details, grant amounts, Solana transaction hashes, and reviewer signatures.

Verification is performed using the  
[`verify-ledger.sh`](../../shipit-fund/ledger/verify-ledger.sh) script, which checks:

- SHA256 integrity of each ledger file
- Duplicate or missing transaction hashes
- Valid declared signature hashes

All results are auditable via the public repository and on-chain validation.

> Transparency isn’t optional — it’s infrastructure.

## 🧾 TreasuryOps Transparency

The **TreasuryOps wallet** is the operational engine behind DevOpsCoin’s ecosystem.

It manages all SOL-based liquidity and funding operations:

- Begins with a **2 % DEVOPS bootstrap allocation (20 M tokens)** for initial liquidity and buyback capacity
- Receives **creator-reward inflows in SOL** from Pump.fun and PumpSwap
- Funds **marketing, operations, liquidity, and buybacks**
- Provides **SOL top-ups** to the Ship-It Fund when grant reserves decline

All transactions are transparent and auditable via:

- **Public Solana wallet activity**
- **Ledger entries** published monthly in `/docs/ledger/TREASURY_LOG.md`
- **Cross-referenced transaction hashes** in verified repo commits

➡ [Treasury Refill Policy →](../token/TREASURY_REFILL_POLICY.md)

## 👤 Founder Vesting Transparency

| Parameter          | Value                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **Allocation**     | 10 % (100 M DEVOPS)            |
| **Cliff**          | 3 months (no release)          |
| **Vesting Period** | 20 months linear (5 % / month) |
| **Network**        | Solana                         |
| **Beneficiary**    | RootSignal (Founder)           |

Tokens unlock trustlessly through an immutable vesting contract.  
All events are visible on-chain and summarized quarterly in the transparency logs.

## 🔎 Verification Methods

Unified verification workflow across all wallets:

- **Solana explorer links (Solscan)** for every transaction
- **Signed ledger entries** under `/docs/ledger/` or in `../../shipit-fund/ledger/`
- **Time-stamped commits** for each movement or top-up
- **Public discussions** for major grant or operational actions

Each ledger entry includes:  
_date, purpose, amount, wallets, hash, signature._  
No hidden transfers. No off-ledger movements.

---

## 📢 Community Oversight

- **Verify** — audit wallet transactions on-chain
- **Review** — cross-check ledger entries with explorers
- **Discuss** — participate via GitHub or Telegram
- **Contribute** — propose open-source projects eligible for funding

---

## 🧱 Guiding Principle

DevOpsCoin is built on **pipelines, proof, and public accountability**.  
Every transaction should be as traceable as a CI pipeline run.

> **“Pipelines, not politics. Verify before you trust.”**
