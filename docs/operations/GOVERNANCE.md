# Governance & Community Oversight

DevOpsCoin is governed by **DevOpsCoin LLC**, operating on the belief that  
**transparency is infrastructure** — and governance should be automated, observable, and verifiable.

This document defines how the **Ship-It Fund** and **Founder Vesting Program** are managed, verified, and publicly auditable.

---

## 🧭 Governance Philosophy

DevOpsCoin applies DevOps principles to crypto governance:

- **Automation > Discretion** — deterministic smart contracts replace manual control
- **Verification > Assumption** — every transfer is observable on-chain
- **Transparency > Hype** — all key actions are logged and verifiable in this repository

Governance is treated like infrastructure: predictable, testable, and open.

## 💰 Core Funds

| Fund                  | Purpose                                                                                                                                  | Controlled By                              | Transparency Mechanism                                  |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ship-It Fund**      | Dual-purpose wallet supporting open-source DevOps projects **and** maintaining token health (buybacks, liquidity, creator reward cycles) | DevOpsCoin LLC (custodial until DAO-ready) | Public Solana wallet + verifiable on-chain transactions |
| **Founder (Vesting)** | Founder allocation (10%) released via 3-month cliff + 5% monthly vesting                                                                 | Smart-contract vesting program             | On-chain vesting record + verified repository source    |

> All other prior wallets — Treasury, Community, or Support NFT funds — have been **deprecated** in favor of this simplified, auditable model.

## ⚙️ Decision Process

All operational changes and fund movements follow a **Ship → Show → Verify** workflow:

1. **Ship** — propose or execute the change via pull request or on-chain transaction
2. **Show** — document and publish the action in `/docs/ledger/TRANSPARENCY_LOG.md`
3. **Verify** — validate on Solscan or through signed transaction hashes

Every governance event leaves a traceable record both on-chain and in-repo.

## 🪙 Ship-It Fund Governance

The **Ship-It Fund** operates as a transparent DevOps-aligned treasury with two primary missions:

1. **Open-Source Funding** — grants, bounties, and sponsorships for DevOps tooling and automation projects
2. **Token Health** — strategic liquidity support, buybacks, and creator reward cycles that sustain ecosystem stability

At launch, the Ship-It Fund receives an **initial bootstrap allocation** to enable early operations and community funding.  
After launch, it is sustained by a **portion of creator rewards** earned from the [$DEVOPS token on Pump.fun](https://pump.fun/).

All fund movements are published quarterly in the **Transparency Log** and verifiable in the [Ship-It Fund repository](https://github.com/DevOpsCoin/shipit-fund).

## 🔒 Founder Vesting Program

The **Founder Vesting Program** ensures long-term alignment:

| Parameter    | Value                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Allocation   | 10% (100M DEVOPS)               |
| Cliff        | 3 months                        |
| Vesting Rate | 5% per month (20 months linear) |
| Network      | Solana                          |
| Beneficiary  | RootSignal (DevOpsCoin Founder) |

Tokens unlock trustlessly through the vesting program and can be claimed only by the founder’s registered wallet.

## 📢 Community Participation

- **Contribute** — open PRs, code, or docs to strengthen the ecosystem
- **Verify** — audit Ship-It Fund transactions directly on Solscan
- **Support** — share, build, or collaborate on open-source DevOps projects funded by the Ship-It Fund
- **Discuss** — join GitHub Discussions or Telegram for roadmap feedback

---

## 🪙 Ship-It Fund Transparency

The **Ship-It Fund** is powered by **creator rewards** generated from the [$DEVOPS token on Pump.fun](https://pump.fun/).  
There are **no transaction taxes or fees** within the token contract itself — instead, the Fund’s sustainability depends on trading volume and creator reward inflows.

When activity slows, Ship-It Fund grants may be **deferred and rolled forward** to the next active period to maintain transparency and fiscal stability.  
For full details on governance, funding cycles, and verified disbursements, see:  
➡ [Ship-It Fund Documentation →](../token/SHIPIT_FUND.md)

## 🧱 Foundation for Open Trust

DevOpsCoin’s governance is not political — it’s procedural.  
Every wallet, contract, and transaction is designed for immutable verification.

> **Pipelines, not politics.**
