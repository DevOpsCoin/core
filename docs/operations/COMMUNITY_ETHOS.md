# DevOpsCoin Community Ethos

**Updated:** October 2025  
**Maintained by:** DevOpsCoin LLC  
**Location:** `/docs/operations/COMMUNITY_ETHOS.md`

---

## Purpose

This document defines the **cultural principles** of the DevOpsCoin community — how we communicate, meme, and build.  
We reject hype for hype’s sake. We believe credibility outlasts hype — humor and realism can coexist.

---

## 1. Core Ethos

> **Ship it. Don’t shill it.**

DevOpsCoin was founded on the belief that crypto’s future belongs to builders, not believers.  
Every wallet, every grant, and every commit is public.  
Our mission is to fund open-source maintainers and the DevOps culture that keeps open-source moving.

We welcome enthusiasm, memes, and community-driven creativity —  
but the project’s foundation will always be **transparency over theatrics**.

---

## 2. The “Shill Paradox”

People will shill $DEVOPS. That’s part of crypto — and that’s fine.  
We just draw a line between **honest enthusiasm** and **empty promises**.

### If you’re going to shill, do it right

- Keep it **clever**, **self-aware**, and **honest**.
- Don’t promise “moonshots” or “lambos.”
- Memes that mock hype _are_ part of the brand.
- The best shill is a **pull request**, not a pump.

> “They hype for noise.  
> We ship for proof.”

## 3. Community Behavior

| Guideline                | Description                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Respect the builders** | Every open-source contributor is part of this ecosystem.         |
| **No false promises**    | We don’t predict price. We publish proof.                        |
| **Keep it clever**       | Humor is encouraged, hopium isn’t.                               |
| **Show receipts**        | If you make claims, back them up — with commits, links, or data. |
| **Stay decentralized**   | Everyone is welcome to contribute, fork, and improve.            |

## 4. Tone & Messaging

Our collective voice is **honest, technical, and self-aware.**  
We don’t imitate pump groups or influencer marketing.  
We speak the language of clarity — concise, ironic, and grounded.

### Examples of the Right Tone

You don’t need to be a developer to get the joke — the point is honesty, clarity, and wit without over-selling.

- ✅ “We deploy. They pray.”
- ✅ “Hope is not a strategy.”
- ✅ “Built, not begged.”
- ✅ “Docs before degen.”
- ✅ “Transparency hits harder than hype.”
- ❌ “$DEVOPS to $10!”
- ❌ “Next 100x moonshot guaranteed!”

Humor should clarify, not exaggerate.  
If it makes someone laugh _and_ understand what $DEVOPS stands for, it fits.

---

## 5. Social Media Guidance

When representing $DEVOPS on **X, Reddit, Telegram, or Discord**:

- Mix **tech culture**, **builder energy**, and **plain realism** — you don’t need to know code to get the spirit.
- Avoid **financial-advice talk** or making price promises.
- Point people to **documentation, progress, or community activity**, not speculation.
- Memes should **celebrate shipping, learning, or transparency**, not just trading.
- Smart humor > loud hype.

The community can create whatever energy it wants — that’s the internet.  
The project’s **voice stays grounded, credible, and builder-first**.

---

## 6. Meme Policy

Memes are welcome — they’re how internet culture spreads ideas.  
For DevOpsCoin, they should **build identity**, not hype.

### Acceptable Memes

- Dev vs Degen contrasts (as commentary, not superiority)
- Code humor (“git commit -m 'Ship it.'”)
- CI/CD jokes, infrastructure metaphors, deployment references
- Parody of hype language (as critique, not imitation)

### Unacceptable Memes

- Price speculation or “get rich” promises
- Attacks on other tokens or founders
- Misleading “investment opportunity” framing
- Anything that contradicts the project’s transparency values

---

## 7. Closing

> “Other coins sell hype.  
> We fund work.”

DevOpsCoin is a **real project built by engineers**, not a passing experiment.  
We know most people will come for the meme — that’s fine —  
but we’re here to prove that something real can grow from it:  
a transparent, disciplined, community-funded ecosystem for builders.

We don’t promise profits. We promise process.

**Ship it. Don’t shill it.**
