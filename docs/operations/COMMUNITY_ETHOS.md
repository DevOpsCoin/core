# DevOpsCoin Community Ethos

**Updated:** October 2025  
**Maintained by:** DevOpsCoin LLC  
**Location:** `/docs/operations/COMMUNITY_ETHOS.md`

---

## Purpose

This document defines the **cultural principles** of the DevOpsCoin community — how we communicate, meme, and build.  
We reject hype for hype’s sake. We believe that **credibility is the new meme**, and that humor and realism can coexist.

---

## 1. Core Ethos

> **Ship it. Don’t shill it.**

DevOpsCoin was founded on the belief that the future of crypto belongs to _builders_, not _believers_.  
Every wallet, every grant, and every commit is public.  
Our mission is to fund open-source maintainers and the DevOps culture that keeps the internet alive.

We welcome enthusiasm, memes, and community-driven creativity —  
but **the message must always reinforce purpose over profit**.

---

## 2. The “Shill Paradox”

We know people will still shill $DEVOPS.  
That’s fine. That’s the irony — and we own it.

### If you’re going to shill, do it right

- Make it **clever**, **self-aware**, and **in on the joke**.
- Don’t promise “moonshots” or “lambos.”
- Memes that mock hype _are_ part of the brand.
- The best shill is a **pull request**, not a pump.

> “They shill to sell dreams.  
> We ship to fund reality.”

## 3. Community Behavior

| Guideline                | Description                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Respect the builders** | Every open-source contributor is part of this ecosystem.         |
| **No false promises**    | We don’t guarantee price. We guarantee transparency.             |
| **Keep it clever**       | Humor is encouraged, hopium isn’t.                               |
| **Show receipts**        | If you make claims, back them up — with commits, links, or data. |
| **Stay decentralized**   | Everyone is welcome to contribute, fork, and improve.            |

## 4. Tone & Messaging

Our collective voice is **honest, technical, and self-aware.**  
We don’t imitate Wall Street Bets or pump groups.  
We speak the language of engineers — concise, ironic, and observant.

**Examples:**

- ✅ “We deploy. They pray.”
- ✅ “Hope is not a strategy.”
- ✅ “If you’re still reading the roadmap, we already shipped it.”
- ❌ “$DEVOPS to $10!”
- ❌ “Guaranteed next 100x coin!”

---

## 5. Social Media Guidance

When representing $DEVOPS on **X, Reddit, Telegram, or Discord**:

- Use **code-culture humor** (commits, pipelines, deploys, merges).
- Avoid **investment talk** or speculative language.
- Always link back to **docs or open-source repos**, not price charts.
- Use memes that **educate**, not manipulate.

> “Our version of marketing is documentation done right.”

---

## 6. Meme Policy

Memes are welcome — they’re how internet culture spreads ideas.  
But for DevOpsCoin, they must **reinforce credibility, not fantasy.**

### Acceptable Memes

- Dev vs Degen contrasts (“They shill / We ship”)
- Code humor (“git commit -m 'Ship it.'”)
- CI/CD jokes, infrastructure metaphors, deployment references
- Parody of hype language (as critique, not imitation)

### Unacceptable Memes

- Price speculation
- Attacks on other tokens or founders
- Misleading “investment opportunity” tone
- Content that contradicts the project’s transparency values

---

## 7. Closing

> “Other coins sell hope.  
> We fund reality.”

DevOpsCoin is a long-term movement that blends DevOps culture with crypto transparency.  
We’re not here to promise profits — we’re here to prove that **meme culture can have integrity** when it’s rooted in engineering discipline.

**Ship it. Don’t shill it.**
