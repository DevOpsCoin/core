# DevOpsCoin Brand Identity

**Updated:** October 2025  
**Maintained by:** DevOpsCoin LLC

---

## Core Brand Positioning

> **DevOpsCoin ($DEVOPS)** — the purpose-driven memecoin built by engineers, not marketers.  
> It rejects the hype, hopium, and hollow promises that dominate crypto culture.  
> Every wallet, every grant, and every commit is public — fueling **The Ship-It Fund**, which funds real open-source builders, not speculation.

---

## Taglines

### Primary (for headers, banners, and logo)

**SHIP IT. DON’T SHILL IT.**

> The defining line between builders and believers.

### Secondary (for documentation and marketing)

**BUILT. NOT BEGGED.**  
**Hope is not a strategy.**

### Supporting Variants (for campaigns or creative use)

- We don’t sell dreams; we fund reality.
- Every wallet, every grant, every commit — public.
- The meme with a changelog.
- Code > Copium.

> Use these selectively across content, choosing tone by context:  
> **Primary = ethos**, **Secondary = conviction**, **Variants = creativity.**

## Mission Statement

### One-liner

> Fund reality — not fantasy.

### Three-liner (for site, press, and investor decks)

> DevOpsCoin is an engineer-founded memecoin that applies DevOps discipline to crypto.  
> The Ship-It Fund fuels open-source projects, while TreasuryOps sustains transparency and growth.  
> We don’t chase pumps — we ship releases.

## Tone & Style Guide

| Category     | Description                                                                                           | Example                                                             |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Voice**    | Confident, technical, anti-hype. Built on facts, not fantasy.                                         | “Every wallet, every grant, every commit — public.”                 |
| **Tone**     | Dry, direct, irreverent toward hype. Sarcasm welcome; dishonesty isn’t.                               | “We deploy. They pray.”                                             |
| **Language** | Minimal, Markdown-native. No emojis, no exclamation marks unless quoting the absurd.                  | “Hope is not a strategy.”                                           |
| **Audience** | Builders, maintainers, and open-source contributors who understand systems and skepticism.            | “We’re not here to promise gains — we’re here to fund maintainers.” |
| **Visuals**  | Mechanical precision: dark UI tones, teal + silver palette, clean geometry. No ‘moon’ or meme tropes. | Infinity loop + gear mark only.                                     |
| **Format**   | Prefer Markdown or plaintext. Every artifact should render clearly in a repo.                         | `README.md`, `WHITEPAPER.md`, `/docs/` pages.                       |

## Visual Identity

| Element             | Specification                                                                                              |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Color**   | `#00B7B3` (Teal from infinity loop logo)                                                                   |
| **Secondary Color** | `#CCCCCC` (Soft silver for typography)                                                                     |
| **Background**      | `#0F1117` (Charcoal)                                                                                       |
| **Typography**      | Sans-serif (Inter, Space Grotesk, or system default); uppercase for $DEVOPS mark                           |
| **Logo Usage**      | Gear + infinity loop mark + `$DEVOPS` text. Rim text: `SHIP IT. DON’T SHILL IT.`                           |
| **Imagery**         | Dev culture visuals — terminals, CI/CD dashboards, commits, build logs. Avoid any “moon” or mascot themes. |
| **Layout Feel**     | Clean, grid-based, industrial. No gradients or excessive shine.                                            |
