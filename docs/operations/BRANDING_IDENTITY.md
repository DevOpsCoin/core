# DevOpsCoin Brand Identity

**Updated:** October 2025  
**Maintained by:** DevOpsCoin LLC

---

## Core Brand Positioning

> **DevOpsCoin ($DEVOPS)** — a memecoin built by engineers, not marketers.  
> It rejects hype and empty promises.  
> Every wallet, every grant, and every commit is public — funding **The Ship-It Fund**, which supports real open-source work.

---

## Taglines

### Primary (for headers, banners, and logo)

**SHIP IT. DON’T SHILL IT.**

> The line between building and selling.

### Secondary (for documentation and reference)

**BUILT. NOT BEGGED.**  
**Hope is not a strategy.**

### Supporting Variants (for limited use)

- We don’t sell dreams; we fund work.
- Every wallet, every grant, every commit — public.
- The meme with a changelog.
- Code > Copium.

> Use sparingly: **Primary = ethos**, **Secondary = conviction**, **Variants = context.**

---

## Mission Statement

### One-liner

> Fund real builders — not fantasies.

### Three-liner

> DevOpsCoin applies DevOps discipline to crypto.  
> The Ship-It Fund supports open-source projects, while TreasuryOps maintains operational clarity.  
> We don’t chase charts — we ship code.

## Tone & Style Guide

| Category     | Description                                                                                            | Example                                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Voice**    | Technical, direct, honest. Built on facts, not slogans.                                                | “Every wallet, every grant, every commit — public.” |
| **Tone**     | Dry and concise. Skeptical of hype. Sarcasm okay; spin is not.                                         | “We deploy. They pray.”                             |
| **Language** | Markdown-native. No emojis or exclamation marks.                                                       | “Hope is not a strategy.”                           |
| **Audience** | Builders, maintainers, and open-source contributors who value proof over pitch.                        | “We fund maintainers, not marketing.”               |
| **Visuals**  | Industrial feel: teal and silver palette, dark background. No mascots or glossy “to the moon” imagery. | Infinity loop + gear mark only.                     |
| **Format**   | Prefer Markdown or plaintext. Everything should render cleanly in a repo.                              | `README.md`, `WHITEPAPER.md`, `/docs/` pages.       |

| **Secondary Color** | `#CCCCCC` (Soft silver for typography)                                                            |
| **Background**      | `#0F1117` (Charcoal)                                                                              |
| **Typography**      | Sans-serif (Inter, Space Grotesk, or system default); `$DEVOPS` in uppercase when used as a mark. |
| **Logo Usage**      | Gear + infinity loop + `$DEVOPS`. Rim text: `SHIP IT. DON’T SHILL IT.`                            |
| **Imagery**         | Developer environments: terminals, CI/CD dashboards, commits, logs. No mascots or hype visuals.   |
| **Layout Feel**     | Clean, grid-based, industrial. No gradients or gloss.                                             |

> **Ship it. Don’t shill it.**
