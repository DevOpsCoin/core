# DevOpsCoin Contributor Handbook

Welcome to the **DevOpsCoin Handbook** — the operating guide for contributors, developers, and maintainers of the $DEVOPS ecosystem.

This section documents how the project is governed, developed, and maintained with transparency and accountability.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

The Handbook defines _how_ DevOpsCoin operates — not just the codebase, but the culture.  
It reflects our commitment to open contribution, responsible governance, and technical rigor.

If the [Tokenomics](../token/TOKENOMICS.md) explain _what_ DevOpsCoin is, the Handbook explains _how we run it_.

## 📘 Sections

### [Governance](./GOVERNANCE.md)

Describes the project’s decision-making structure, including the roles of the Founder, Community Wallet, and Ship-It Fund.  
Outlines how proposals, audits, and community decisions are handled post-launch.

---

### [Development Process](./DEVELOPMENT.md)

Documents how the codebase is maintained — branching, testing, deployment, and versioning guidelines for both smart contracts and the website.

---

### [Transparency Policy](./TRANSPARENCY.md)

Outlines how project wallets, vesting, and fund flows are publicly verified.  
Explains what’s visible on-chain, what’s published to GitHub, and how DevOpsCoin maintains its “no surprises” ethos.

---

### [Internal Contribution Guide](./CONTRIBUTING_INTERNAL.md)

Defines contributor expectations, coding standards, and review workflow.  
Intended for developers working under DevOpsCoin LLC or verified contributors.

---

## ⚙️ Contribution Workflow

1. **Fork the Repository** → Start from `main`, create feature branches per scope.
2. **Run Tests and Linters** → `pnpm lint && pnpm test` ensures uniform code quality.
3. **Submit a Pull Request** → PRs trigger automated checks and review by maintainers.
4. **Transparency Tagging** → All merges that affect tokenomics or vesting must include the `#transparency` tag for audit visibility.

## 🛡️ Principles

- **Open Source First** — All core contracts and site code remain public.
- **Immutable Fairness** — Smart contract logic is transparent and renounced post-launch.
- **Ship-It Culture** — A portion of token fees supports real DevOps projects through grants and NFT rewards.
- **No Speculation without Substance** — Memecoin energy, but developer integrity.
