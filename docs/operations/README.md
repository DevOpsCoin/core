# DevOpsCoin Contributor Handbook

The **DevOpsCoin Handbook** defines how contributors, developers, and maintainers operate within the $DEVOPS ecosystem.  
It sets expectations for collaboration, development, and governance — grounded in **transparency, automation, and accountability.**

---

## Purpose

The Handbook outlines **how** DevOpsCoin operates — not just the codebase, but the culture behind it.  
It reflects a commitment to open contribution, responsible governance, and engineering discipline.

If [Tokenomics](../token/TOKENOMICS.md) explains **what** DevOpsCoin is, the Handbook defines **how it’s run** and maintained day-to-day.

## Sections

### [Governance](./GOVERNANCE.md)

Defines how decisions are made and how funds move.  
Covers the operational structure of the **Ship-It Fund**, **TreasuryOps Wallet**, and **Founder Vesting Program**, along with transparency and oversight practices.

---

### [Development Process](./DEVELOPMENT.md)

Outlines codebase management — branching, testing, deployment, and versioning standards for both the website and Solana programs.  
Focuses on predictability, consistency, and quality enforcement through automation.

---

### [Transparency Policy](./TRANSPARENCY.md)

Documents how wallets, vesting schedules, and fund movements are publicly verified.  
Explains what’s visible on-chain, what’s logged in GitHub, and how DevOpsCoin enforces a transparency-first framework.

---

### [Internal Contribution Guide](./CONTRIBUTING_INTERNAL.md)

Details contributor expectations, review flow, and internal CI/CD standards.  
Intended for maintainers and verified contributors operating under DevOpsCoin LLC.

---

## Contribution Workflow

1. **Fork the Repository** — Start from `main`; create feature branches per change scope.
2. **Run Tests and Linters** — Use `pnpm lint && pnpm test` to validate before commit.
3. **Submit a Pull Request** — Every PR triggers automated checks and mandatory review.
4. **Transparency Tagging** — Any PR affecting tokenomics, vesting, or fund flow must include a `#transparency` tag for audit visibility.

## Principles

- **Open Source First** — All core contracts and app code remain public and auditable.
- **Predictable Governance** — Rules are procedural, not political; decisions leave proof.
- **Ship-It Ethos** — Token-funded grants support open-source DevOps and real builders.
- **Accountability by Design** — Automation replaces assumption; ledgers replace promises.
- **No Empty Hype** — The project invites excitement, but always anchored in substance.
