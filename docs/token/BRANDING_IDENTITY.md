## Tone & Style Guide

| Category     | Description                                                                                                         | Example                                                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Voice**    | Confident, technical, and grounded in engineering culture. Avoid hype or buzzwords.                                 | “Every commit, every transaction — observable and verifiable.”       |
| **Tone**     | Transparent, direct, with a dry sense of humor when appropriate.                                                    | “Pipelines, not politics.”                                           |
| **Language** | Clear, minimal, Markdown-native. No emojis, no fluff.                                                               | “Ship fast. Show receipts.”                                          |
| **Audience** | DevOps engineers, open-source contributors, and builders who understand crypto mechanics.                           | “This isn’t about hype; it’s about sustaining the tools we rely on.” |
| **Visuals**  | Clean typography, dark backgrounds, teal + silver palette from infinity loop logo. Avoid gradients and excess glow. | Logo mark + type only; no animated elements.                         |
| **Format**   | Prefer Markdown or plaintext. Every asset should be readable in a repo, not just a browser.                         | `README.md`, `whitepaper.html`, `docs/` content.                     |

## Visual Identity

| Element             | Specification                                                                                              |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Color**   | `#00B7B3` (Teal from infinity loop logo)                                                                   |
| **Secondary Color** | `#CCCCCC` (Soft silver text tone)                                                                          |
| **Background**      | Charcoal (`#0F1117`)                                                                                       |
| **Typography**      | Sans-serif (Inter, Poppins, or system default); bold weights for $DEVOPS mark                              |
| **Logo Usage**      | The infinity loop mark + `$DEVOPS` text. No slogan lockup. Maintain transparent backgrounds for overlays.  |
| **Imagery**         | Dev culture motifs: terminals, build pipelines, logs, merge commits. Avoid overused “crypto moon” imagery. |
