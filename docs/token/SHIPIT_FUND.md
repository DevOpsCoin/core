# Ship-It Fund

The **Ship-It Fund** is the beating heart of the **DevOpsCoin ($DEVOPS)** ecosystem — a transparent grant program that transforms creator rewards from the $DEVOPS token into real support for open-source DevOps builders.

It funds automators, tinkerers, and open-source maintainers who embody the spirit of **“Ship it, don’t hype it.”**

---

## 💡 Overview

The Ship-It Fund is powered by **creator rewards** from the [$DEVOPS token on Pump.fun](https://pump.fun/).  
There are **no transaction taxes or embedded fees** in the token contract — instead, the Fund receives periodic allocations from creator reward inflows.

Each funding cycle supports two key objectives:

1. **Open-Source Grants** — Tools, dashboards, scripts, bots, and educational projects that advance DevOps culture  
2. **Ecosystem Health** — Activities that strengthen the $DEVOPS token, such as liquidity support and sustainability efforts  

Funding activity directly depends on token trading volume.  
If rewards are low in a given month, grant disbursements are **deferred** to the next active period — ensuring transparency and long-term sustainability.

All activity aligns with the broader [Governance Framework](./handbook/GOVERNANCE.md) and transparency policies within the DevOpsCoin project.
