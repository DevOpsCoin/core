# Ship-It Fund

The **Ship-It Fund** is the beating heart of the **DevOpsCoin ($DEVOPS)** ecosystem — a transparent grant program that transforms community momentum into real support for open-source DevOps builders.

It funds automators, tinkerers, and open-source maintainers who embody the spirit of **“Ship it, don’t hype it.”**

---

## 💡 Overview

The Ship-It Fund operates as a **dedicated DEVOPS grant treasury**, powered by creator rewards earned from the [$DEVOPS token on Pump.fun](https://pump.fun/).  
There are **no transaction taxes or embedded fees** in the token contract — instead, the Fund receives periodic top-ups from the **TreasuryOps wallet**, which collects SOL from creator reward inflows.

Each monthly funding cycle supports one clear mission:

1. **Open-Source Grants** — Tools, dashboards, scripts, bots, educational content, and infrastructure projects that advance DevOps culture.

The Ship-It Fund **never sells DEVOPS** or performs liquidity operations.  
All market, buyback, and operational activity is handled separately by the **TreasuryOps wallet** to maintain clean accounting boundaries.

Funding activity depends on trading volume.  
If volume or creator rewards are low in a given month, grant disbursements are **deferred and rolled forward** to the next active period — ensuring long-term sustainability without forced selling or dilution.

## ⚙️ Governance & Oversight

The Ship-It Fund operates under **DevOpsCoin LLC** governance and adheres to the project’s core DevOps principle:

> **Ship → Show → Verify**

1. **Ship** — Prepare the proposal or transaction.  
2. **Show** — Publish rationale and record in the ledger.  
3. **Verify** — Execute on-chain and confirm transaction hash.  

All activity aligns with the broader [Governance Framework](../operations/GOVERNANCE.md) and [Transparency Policy](../project/TRANSPARENCY.md).

---

## 💰 Relationship to TreasuryOps

The **TreasuryOps wallet (SOL)** funds the Ship-It Fund when grant reserves decline.  
It manages creator reward inflows, marketing, liquidity, and operational costs — keeping the Ship-It Fund focused exclusively on open-source grants.

> TreasuryOps = SOL operations  
> Ship-It Fund = DEVOPS grants

This separation ensures clarity for tax reporting, governance, and on-chain verification.
