# DevOpsCoin Wallet Structure

**Token Name:** DevOpsCoin  
**Symbol:** DEVOPS  
**Network:** Solana  
**Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 DEVOPS  
**Ownership:** Creator authority revoked post-launch (pump.fun graduation)

## Overview

DevOpsCoin follows a **three-wallet architecture** designed for maximum transparency, accountability, and simplicity.  
All wallets and allocations are publicly verifiable on-chain.  
There are **no multisig treasuries**, **no hidden developer wallets**, and **no adjustable parameters** once creator authority is revoked.

The project operates with three distinct wallets, each with a single purpose:

1. **Founder Vesting Wallet (10%)** — Trustless vesting with a 3-month cliff and 20-month linear release.  
2. **Ship-It Fund Wallet (5% DEVOPS)** — Dedicated grant treasury supporting open-source projects and community initiatives.  
3. **TreasuryOps Wallet (SOL)** — Operations wallet for marketing, liquidity, and buybacks; also funds Ship-It top-ups.

## TreasuryOps Overview

The **TreasuryOps wallet** operates as the project’s **operational and liquidity engine**:

- Receives creator-reward inflows in SOL from [pump.fun](https://pump.fun/)  
- Funds marketing, exchange liquidity, and ecosystem operations  
- Executes buybacks and manages community bounties as approved  
- Provides **top-ups** to the Ship-It Fund when grant reserves fall below target  

All TreasuryOps activity is publicly logged and auditable on Solscan and in the transparency ledger.

---

## Ship-It Fund Transparency

The **Ship-It Fund** begins with a **5 % DEVOPS bootstrap allocation**, then continues to grow through top-ups provided by TreasuryOps.  
It supports open-source grants exclusively and never performs token sales or swaps.  
When trading volume slows, grant cycles are **deferred and rolled forward** to maintain fiscal stability and transparency.
