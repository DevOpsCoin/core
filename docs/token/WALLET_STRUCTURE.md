# DevOpsCoin Wallet Structure

**Token Name:** DevOpsCoin  
**Symbol:** DEVOPS  
**Network:** Solana  
**Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 DEVOPS  
**Ownership:** Creator authority revoked post-launch (pump.fun graduation)  

---

## Overview

DevOpsCoin follows a minimal, transparent wallet model — optimized for **trust, traceability, and sustainability**.  
All wallets and allocations are public and verifiable on-chain.  
There are **no multisig treasuries**, **no hidden developer wallets**, and **no adjustable parameters** once creator authority is revoked.

The project operates with **two core wallets** and one circulating supply pool.

## Wallet Allocations

| Wallet Type | Address | Allocation | Amount (DEVOPS) | Description |
|--------------|----------|-------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Founder Wallet** | *(to be published post-deployment)* | **10 %** | 100,000,000 | Founder allocation (RootSignal). Locked with a 3-month cliff and 5 % monthly vesting for 20 months. |
| **Ship-It / Operations Wallet** | *(to be published post-deployment)* | **5 %** | 50,000,000 | Bootstrap fund supporting open-source DevOps projects **and** maintaining token health (buybacks, liquidity, creator-reward cycles). Sustained long-term by creator-reward inflows from pump.fun. |
| **Public Supply (Circulating + LP)** | *pump.fun + Raydium liquidity* | **85 %** | 850,000,000 | Distributed to the public through the pump.fun launch and subsequent Raydium market liquidity. |

All wallet addresses will be published and verified via **Solscan** upon token deployment.

## Vesting Contracts

| Contract | Purpose | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Founder Vesting Program** | Founder | Enforces a 3-month cliff and 5 % monthly vesting thereafter (20-month linear release). Immutable once deployed. |
| *(Future Option)* Ship-It Grants | Contributors | Potential Solana-based programs may extend Ship-It Fund grants into time-locked vesting for recurring contributors. |

All vesting implementations will be published and verified in this repository once deployed.

---

## Ownership & Control

| Category | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Renounce Policy** | Creator authority is permanently revoked after launch; no admin keys or variable controls remain. |
| **Liquidity** | LP tokens are locked automatically through the pump.fun → Raydium graduation process. |
| **Transparency** | All wallet addresses, contract sources, and fund movements are logged in `/docs/ledger/TRANSPARENCY_LOG.md` for public verification. |

---

## Ship-It Fund Transparency

The **Ship-It Fund** begins with a **5 % bootstrap allocation** at launch, then continues to grow through **creator-reward inflows** generated from the [$DEVOPS token on pump.fun](https://pump.fun/).  
When trading volume is low, grants may be deferred and rolled forward to future months to ensure sustainable and auditable funding.
