## Overview

DevOpsCoin ($DEVOPS) is a **fixed-supply Solana token** designed to merge *Dev culture* with *meme energy*.  
Every action supports the long-term mission of the **Ship-It Fund** — an on-chain fund that backs open-source DevOps projects and strengthens token health through sustainable operations.

No reflections. No minting. No stealth taxes.  
Once creator authority is revoked, the token becomes immutable.

## Token Distribution

| Allocation | Percentage | Amount (DEVOPS) | Description |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Founder (RootSignal)** | 10 % | 100,000,000 | Vested with a 3-month cliff and 5 % monthly vesting thereafter (20 months). |
| **Ship-It / Operations Wallet** | 5 % | 50,000,000 | Bootstrap fund supporting open-source DevOps grants and maintaining token health (buybacks, liquidity, creator reward cycles). Sustained long-term by creator rewards from pump.fun. |
| **Public Supply (Circulating + LP)** | 85 % | 850,000,000 | Circulating supply distributed via pump.fun launch and Raydium liquidity. |

> The Ship-It Fund receives a **5 % initial bootstrap allocation** at launch, then grows through creator-reward inflows as volume accrues.

## Fee Structure

DevOpsCoin charges **no transaction taxes** on the Solana mainnet.  
Instead, a portion of **creator rewards** earned from pump.fun trading volume funds the **Ship-It Fund** on an ongoing basis.

| Mechanism | Source | Destination | Purpose |
|------------|---------|--------------|----------|
| **Creator Reward Split** | pump.fun launch mechanics | Ship-It Fund Wallet | Funds open-source grants, token stabilization, and liquidity reinforcement |

Once the token graduates, the Ship-It Fund remains the only operational wallet receiving ongoing support.

## Contract Integrity

- **Fixed Supply:** 1 B DEVOPS minted once at deployment  
- **Immutable Authority:** Creator privileges permanently revoked post-launch  
- **No Admin Functions:** No minting, burning, or modification possible  
- **Transparent Fund Routing:** Ship-It Fund transactions are publicly verifiable on Solscan  
- **Security:** Solana native SPL token (Metaplex standard), no proxy or reflection logic

## Economic Philosophy

DevOpsCoin embodies DevOps discipline within the memecoin economy — automation, transparency, and continuous improvement.  
The **Ship-It Fund** converts community energy into real open-source outcomes, funding tools, contributors, and innovation that strengthen the broader developer ecosystem.

> “Every token transfer fuels the pipeline.”

## 🪙 Ship-It Fund Transparency

The **Ship-It Fund** is powered by **creator rewards** generated from the [$DEVOPS token on Pump.fun](https://pump.fun/).  
There are **no transaction taxes or fees** within the token contract itself — instead, the Fund’s sustainability depends on trading volume and creator reward inflows.  

When activity slows, Ship-It Fund grants may be **deferred and rolled forward** to the next active period to maintain transparency and fiscal stability.
