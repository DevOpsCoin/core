## Overview

**DevOpsCoin ($DEVOPS)** is a **fixed-supply Solana token** that merges _Dev culture_ with _meme energy_.  
Its purpose is to fund open-source DevOps innovation through transparent, rule-based allocations managed on-chain.

There are **no taxes, no reflections, and no admin privileges.**  
Once creator authority is revoked, the token supply and structure become immutable.

DevOpsCoin operates under a **three-wallet model** for long-term transparency and sustainability:

1. **Founder Vesting Wallet (10%)** ‚Äî Trustless linear vesting to ensure founder alignment.  
2. **Ship-It Fund Wallet (5%)** ‚Äî Dedicated DEVOPS treasury for open-source grants and ecosystem support.  
3. **TreasuryOps Wallet (SOL)** ‚Äî SOL-based wallet for operations, liquidity, marketing, and buybacks; also funds Ship-It top-ups.

## Fee Structure

DevOpsCoin charges **no transaction fees or reflections** on the Solana mainnet.  
Ecosystem funding flows from **creator rewards** generated by trading activity on [pump.fun](https://pump.fun/).

| Mechanism              | Source                    | Destination             | Purpose                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Creator Reward Flow** | pump.fun trading activity | TreasuryOps Wallet (SOL) | Receives SOL-denominated rewards from pump.fun                      |
| **Top-Up Transfer**     | TreasuryOps Wallet        | Ship-It Fund Wallet      | Maintains DEVOPS grant reserves for monthly distributions           |
| **Grant Disbursement**  | Ship-It Fund Wallet       | Public Recipients        | Funds open-source DevOps projects; defers grants if volume is low   |

> All liquidity, marketing, and buyback operations occur only from the **TreasuryOps wallet**, never the Ship-It Fund.

## Contract Integrity

- **Fixed Supply:** 1 B DEVOPS minted once at deployment  
- **Immutable Authority:** Creator privileges permanently revoked post-launch  
- **No Admin Functions:** No minting, burning, or modification possible  
- **Transparent Funds:** Ship-It and TreasuryOps wallets tracked publicly on Solscan  
- **Security:** Solana native SPL token (Metaplex standard), no proxy or reflection logic

## Economic Philosophy

DevOpsCoin applies DevOps discipline to crypto: automation, observability, and continuous delivery ‚Äî for transparency instead of hype.  
The three-wallet structure ensures predictable accountability:

- **Founder Vesting** ‚Üí long-term alignment  
- **Ship-It Fund** ‚Üí pure grant funding  
- **TreasuryOps** ‚Üí operational sustainability  

> **‚ÄúEvery trade fuels the pipeline.‚Äù**

## ü™ô Ship-It Fund Transparency

The **Ship-It Fund** is powered by **creator-reward inflows** converted and routed from the TreasuryOps wallet.  
There are **no on-chain taxes or fees** ‚Äî sustainability is entirely driven by trading volume and community engagement.

When market activity slows, grant cycles may be **rolled forward** until reserves recover, maintaining stability and integrity.
