# DevOpsCoin Creator Rewards Allocation

**Network:** Solana  
**Launch Platform:** [pump.fun](https://pump.fun/)  
**Maintained by:** DevOpsCoin LLC  
**Last Updated:** October 2025

## Overview

DevOpsCoin does **not** use transaction taxes or on-chain fee mechanics.  
Instead, funding for the **Ship-It Fund** comes from two transparent sources:

1. An **initial bootstrap allocation** at launch to seed operations and early grants.
2. An **ongoing portion of creator rewards** generated from the $DEVOPS token’s trading activity on **pump.fun**.

This model ensures that the fund’s sustainability is tied directly to community engagement and market volume rather than perpetual taxes.
