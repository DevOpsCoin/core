# Treasury Refill Policy

**Maintained By:** DevOpsCoin LLC  
**Network:** Solana  
**Last Updated:** October 2025 — Three-Wallet Model + 2% Bootstrap Revision

## Purpose

This policy defines how the **TreasuryOps wallet** manages liquidity, operations, and Ship-It Fund top-ups.  
Its purpose is to maintain consistent funding for open-source grants while keeping liquidity stable and fully auditable.

## Top-Up Triggers & Guidelines

| Condition                                              | TreasuryOps Action                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ship-It Fund Reserve < Target (5% of Total Supply)** | Execute a DEVOPS top-up within 7 days.                     |
| **Monthly Grant Cycle Deferred**                       | Roll funds forward; no forced sales or liquidity changes.  |
| **Sustained Elevated Volume (≥ 1 month)**              | Evaluate additional top-ups or expanded grant allocations. |
| **Sustained Low Volume (≥ 2 months)**                  | Pause top-ups and preserve liquidity until recovery.       |

---

## Liquidity & Buyback Policy

- All buybacks are executed **only by TreasuryOps** when reserves and market conditions support them.
- Monthly buyback activity may not exceed **10% of SOL reserves**.
- Each buyback must be disclosed post-execution with its Solana transaction hash and signature.
- DEVOPS acquired through buybacks may be **burned or redeployed** for liquidity — never resold.

---

## Reporting & Verification

Every top-up, transfer, or buyback must record:

- Date and purpose
- Amount (DEVOPS or SOL)
- Source and destination wallets
- Solana transaction hash
- Verification signature

All entries are published monthly under:  
`/docs/ledger/TREASURY_LOG.md`

---

## Sustainability Rules

- Refills must **not reduce SOL reserves below 50%** of TreasuryOps total holdings.
- No forced sales to meet Ship-It cycles or grant demand.
- Any change to allocation ratios requires prior disclosure and ledger confirmation.
- All actions must be verifiable via on-chain transaction and timestamped commit.

## Principle

Refill what’s **earned**, not what’s **expected.**  
DevOpsCoin funds work — not hype.
