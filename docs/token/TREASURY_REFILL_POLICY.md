## Purpose

## Top-Up Triggers & Guidelines

| Condition                                               | TreasuryOps Action                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ship-It Fund Reserve < Target (5 % of Total Supply)** | Initiate DEVOPS top-up from TreasuryOps within 7 days.                 |
| **Monthly Grant Cycle Deferment**                       | Roll funds forward; no forced sales or liquidity moves.                |
| **High Trading Volume Month**                           | Optionally increase top-up or allocate additional grants.              |
| **Sustained Low Volume (> 2 months)**                   | Pause new top-ups; maintain liquidity buffer until conditions improve. |

---

## Liquidity & Buyback Policy

- Buybacks occur **only** from TreasuryOps when market conditions support it.
- Buyback volume never exceeds **10 % of SOL reserves** per month.
- All buybacks are announced post-execution with transaction hash disclosure.
- DEVOPS acquired via buybacks may be burned or held for liquidity seeding, not re-sold.

---

## Reporting & Verification

Each top-up or operational transfer must be logged with:

- Date and purpose
- Token amount (DEVOPS or SOL)
- Wallet addresses
- Transaction hash
- Verification signature

Reports are published monthly in:  
`/docs/ledger/TREASURY_LOG.md`

---

## Sustainability Principles

- No forced sales for liquidity or grants.
- Refills must preserve at least **50 % of SOL reserves** after execution.
- Changes to allocation percentages require public disclosure and ledger amendment.
- All funding actions are reproducible via on-chain proof and time-stamped commit.
