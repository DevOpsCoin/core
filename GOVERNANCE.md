# Governance & Community Oversight

DevOpsCoin is governed by **DevOpsCoin LLC**, operating under the principle that **transparency is infrastructure**.  
This document defines how the **Treasury**, **Community Wallet**, and **Ship-It Fund** are managed, how funds are verified, and how contributors and supporters participate.

---

### 🧭 Governance Philosophy

DevOpsCoin applies DevOps principles — automation, observability, and accountability — to crypto governance.  
We believe in:

- **Automation over discretion**
- **Verification over assumption**
- **Transparency over hype**

All fund operations are executed by **DevOpsCoin LLC** and recorded either on-chain or in this repository for independent verification.

| **Support NFT**       | Optional supporter NFT; proceeds flow to the Ship-It Fund          | DevOpsCoin LLC             | Smart-contract ledger + quarterly reporting |
| **Founder (Vesting)** | Founder allocation governed by vesting contract                    | Smart contract (enforced)  | On-chain vesting visibility                 |

> The **Founder wallet** follows a fixed on-chain vesting schedule and is **not used for active treasury or fund operations**.  
> Vesting is transparent and verifiable on BNB Smart Chain.

### ⚙️ Decision Process

All governance follows a **Ship → Show → Verify** workflow:

1. **Ship** — Prepare or propose a change (pull request, issue, or operational plan)
2. **Show** — Review and document publicly
3. **Verify** — Execute on-chain or publish signed verification in this repo

Each action leaves a traceable, auditable record.

### 💰 Support NFT

The **Support NFT** provides a symbolic way for community members to contribute.  
Funds are directed to the **Ship-It Fund** for open-source and DevOps-aligned initiatives.

> The Support NFT is **not** a reward, yield, or governance instrument — it’s purely a way to back the project’s mission.

> “Pipelines, not politics.”
