        I've been in software development for over 25 years, with the last 15 spent deep in DevOps.
        When I look back, open source has been at the center of everything. Every deployment
        pipeline, every bit of automation, every tool that saved my sanity during late-night outages
        came from people who built something useful and decided to share it. Without open source, my
        career would have been a lot harder, and the internet as we know it wouldn't exist. It's not
        just about code, it's about the people who fix things they didn't break and improve things
        they don't even use, just because they can.

        A few years ago, I got into crypto. Like most, I started trading, learning, experimenting,
        and, of course, laughing at the chaos of the memecoin world. But after a while, the pattern
        started to show itself. Most of these “me me coins” really lived up to the name, everyone
        shouting me first, me richer, me out before the rug gets pulled. It was entertaining, sure,
        but hollow. I wanted to take that same energy and do something different with it. I wanted
        to prove a coin could still be fun and community-driven, while actually standing for
        something that matters. And let’s be honest, I’m not allergic to profit either. If I can
        build something that helps others and still makes some money along the way, that feels like
        the right kind of win.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <img

        />
        That's where DevOps Coin came from. It's part tribute, part experiment, and part reminder
        that giving back doesn't have to be boring. The idea was simple: if memecoins are about me
        me, then this one should be about we. The open source community built the tools that made my
        entire career possible, and I wanted to create a project that put something back into that
        ecosystem. That's where the Ship-It Fund was born, turning a piece of every trade into real
        support for open source DevOps projects. Every time someone trades or holds DevOps Coin,
        they're helping the people who keep the internet running quietly behind the curtain.

        />
        We're still early, still building, still figuring things out as we go. There's no big
        company here, no massive marketing team, just a belief that a token can have purpose. Over
        time, I hope this becomes more than just a coin, maybe a way to fund tools, recognize
        maintainers, or even inspire others to build projects that give back in their own way. If it
        stays small, that's fine. If it grows, even better. The point is to keep shipping and keep
        supporting the builders who make all of this possible.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        <img
          src="/mystory/p5.png"
          alt="shipping with purpose and fun"
          className="w-28 h-28 object-cover rounded-lg shadow-md border border-cyan-800 mt-1 ml-4 float-right flex-shrink-0"
          style={{ float: "right", marginLeft: "1rem", marginBottom: "0.5rem" }}
        />
        DevOps Coin isn't about chasing hype. It's about turning a joke into a thank you. It's about
        taking the same spirit that drives developers to stay up late fixing someone else's bug and
        channeling it into something that helps others do the same. If you've ever shipped something
        that broke, fixed it, and shipped again anyway, you already understand what this project
        stands for. It's about shipping with purpose, and maybe having a little fun while we do it.
