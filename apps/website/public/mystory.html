    <h1>My Story (and the start of Our Story)</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">ChatGPT said:</div>
    <p>
      I’ve been in software development for over 25 years, with the last 15
      spent deep in DevOps. When I look back, open source has been at the center
      of everything. Every deployment pipeline, every bit of automation, every
      tool that saved my sanity during late-night outages came from people who
      built something useful and decided to share it. Without open source, my
      career would have been a lot harder, and the internet as we know it
      wouldn’t exist. It’s not just about code; it’s about the people who fix
      things they didn’t break and improve things they don’t even use, just
      because they can.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few years ago, I got into crypto. Like most, I started trading,
      learning, experimenting, and, of course, laughing at the chaos of the
      memecoin world. But after a while, the pattern started to show itself.
      Most of these “me me coins” really lived up to the name — everyone
      shouting me first, me richer, me out before the rug gets pulled. It was
      entertaining, sure, but hollow. I wanted to take that same energy and do
      something different with it. I wanted to prove a coin could still be fun
      and community-driven, while actually standing for something that matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s where DevOps Coin came from. It’s part tribute, part experiment,
      and part reminder that giving back doesn’t have to be boring. The idea was
      simple: if memecoins are about me me, then this one should be about we.
      The open source community built the tools that made my entire career
      possible, and I wanted to create a project that put something back into
      that ecosystem. That’s where the Ship-It Fund was born, turning a piece of
      every trade into real support for open source DevOps projects. Every time
      someone trades or holds DevOps Coin, they’re helping the people who keep
      the internet running quietly behind the curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      We’re still early, still building, still figuring things out as we go.
      There’s no big company here, no massive marketing team, just a belief that
      a token can have purpose. Over time, I hope this becomes more than just a
      coin — maybe a way to fund tools, recognize maintainers, or even inspire
      others to build projects that give back in their own way. If it stays
      small, that’s fine. If it grows, even better. The point is to keep
      shipping and keep supporting the builders who make all of this possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      DevOps Coin isn’t about chasing hype. It’s about turning a joke into a
      thank you. It’s about taking the same spirit that drives developers to
      stay up late fixing someone else’s bug and channeling it into something
      that helps others do the same. If you’ve ever shipped something that
      broke, fixed it, and shipped again anyway, you already understand what
      this project stands for. It’s about shipping with purpose, and maybe
      having a little fun while we do it.
